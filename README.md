Empirical Data BK1 at RUC

Welcome to my Empirical Data repository! 
This repo contains my solutions to all the exercises from Basic Course 1 at Roskilde University (RUC), 
completed a few years ago. I solved all of them when I worked as a TA there.

About the Course
Natural science is all about understanding the real world, 
and empirical data — collected through experiments or observations — plays a central role.

Basic Course 1 focuses on:
📈 Describing and presenting various types of empirical data.
🔍 Analyzing and interpreting data using quantitative and qualitative methods.
🛠️ Applying these methods to solve real-world problems.

What's Inside?
Exercise Solutions: Step-by-step solutions for each exercise.
Data Analysis: Insights and results from empirical datasets.
Code & Methods: Python/Matlab scripts for analysis.
